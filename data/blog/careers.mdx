I was on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanhalexander/) recently and it struck me how _neat_ everyone's working
life seems to be online.

**Here**, then _here_, then _this_, and... _that_. Does everyone but me bestride the working world like a great
Vulcan collossus, logically determining that because of **X** environmentally determined characteristic
& **Y** genetically codified desire, **Z** is the [late stage capitalism](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210525-why-the-next-stage-of-capitalism-is-coming)
role that they should, will, and were always going to, have?

Let us consult the great [bastions](https://www.oed.com/) of order in the world who keep us from talking like [Humpty Dumpty](https://www.tate.org.uk/tate-etc/issue-23-autumn-2011/when-i-use-word-it-means-just-what-i-choose-it-mean) too often.

### **Career**

---

#### _noun_

##### _"the job or series of jobs that you do during your working life, especially if you continue to get better jobs and earn more money"_

---

More accurate in my experience is:

---

#### _verb_

##### _"to move fast and in a way that is out of control"_

I can already here the very, very professional among you frowning. You know what? I wish I could frown in
good faith too. _Your_ career has been a carefully planned series of positions & experiences that just so
happen to slot oh-so-neatly into a 60 secondelevator pitch of definitely not post-rationalised moves that
have led you to be the perfect candidate for _this_ job/position/funding. I applaud you. I only really
learned to start being strategic about my life moves after I left university, which in itself was probably
a blunder.

Don't get me wrong. I will absolutely provide the tidied whys & wherefores of why I made which move when for
purposes of an interview or seeming like I have at least some of my s\*\*t together at a dinner party. That's
one of the pleasant advantages of reflecting on life: understanding yourself - what motivates you, what you
like & what you don't, when the grass is actually greener & when its just that fake stuff you get from B&M.

Previously, I: was going to study medicine (until I decided I really wans't & escaped to Japan for a year to try & find
Haruki Murakami's [jazz club](https://petercatofficial.com/2020/06/11/how-murakami-went-from-jazz-bar-owner-to-world-renown-author-in-a-day/)
only to find he'd moved on but that's another story), sold the good gym life [here](https://sport.leeds.ac.uk/the-edge/);
managed this London [coffee shop](https://gailsbread.co.uk/bakeries/clapham-old-town/) (_sorry, "artisan bakery"_); and
taught secondary school English [here](https://www.stedmundarrowsmith.org.uk/) in Liverpool with the educational charity
[TeachFirst](https://www.teachfirst.org.uk/).

I was always playing around with code, reading about technology & business, and always had vague idea that I'd
do something related eventually. It wasn't untill I was 24 that I'd actually realise that there were
[paths](https://northcoders.com/) to build for a living if you hadn't done computer science or maths at university.
Once I realised that, it was a case of saying goodbye to my students & enduring Northern rail for 4 months
between Liverpool & Manchester to get my skills to a marketable level.

Since then, I've learned _a lot_ through doing, reading, asking questions of amazing peers & lead engineers
who were incredibly generous with their time & knowledge - and still are. More recently, I've found myself in
a place professionally where I fulfil that pleasurable teaching prediliction can help others learn - about Domain
Driven Design, eventsourcing, event driven architectures, & distributed systems. More often that not, that teaching
is half jumping into learning something & sharing it as I go (currently, devops & observability).

Come to think of it, that was what I tried to bring to my teaching & probably my general approach to life. Be confident
enough, to learn, well & fast, but be humble enough to share what you learn & know that you will never know it _all_
and that there's always someone who sees something you haven't or actually does bestride the topic like a great.
Vulcan. collossus. Befriend them.
