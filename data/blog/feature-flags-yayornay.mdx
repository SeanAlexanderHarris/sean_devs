**The scenario**

Our team is about to release a feature that allows cinch partners to price the vehicles they are selling
on the cinch platform.

The pricing widget has been developed behind a simple feature flag that uses user roles to govern whether
or not to render the relevant modal. Our product owner led discovery that revealed the features that were
likely to be deliverable and impactful. Our business analysts detailled the business context that allowed
us to plan our interactions with other systems and be mindful of bounded contexts to help us maintain a
clean architecture. Our designer created designs for the user interactions and experiences to optimise how
users would encounter pricing widget. In short, we were heroes.

We've all worked hard together but I can't help but think we could deliver smaller increments, more quickly
together by using _feature flags_.

Let me retell the story above but in a world where the team is using highly configurable feature flags to
improve and accelerate their progress.

Engineers implemented three different designs behind feature flags that Emily, our designer, was able to
switch on (release) for short planned periods in proudction whilst on a call with partners so she could
get live feedback on in-production designs. The designs were "dumb" insofar as they were not backed by any
api calls or writes to databases, but nevertheless they provided a "real" feature to work with. Based off
of these feedback, Emily was able to adjsut the designs, deprecate options for two on the feature flag, and
plan with the team to enrich the remaining successful design. A key part of the user experience is how they
encounter error messages and flows - both interations and copy are important. Again, after engineers had
deployed two different copy & error handling implementations, Emily was able to release the iteration to two
different partners & record the user sessions via Datadog's real user monitoring (RUM) functionality to use
as evidence for a decision. When the secure, tested feature is ready, the team can coordinate and the product
owner can schedule the 'ring release' for the next morning. That release can begin with smaller or engaged
partners and, as long as any errors fall within acceptable parameters, continue to release to larger partners.
If at any point there should be some unforeseen and potentially catastrophic error (in which case something
has gone wrong earlier in the development process), the feature can be retracted via a feature flag "kill switch".

- Engineers: control the feature flag in-code by checking against user roles
- UX: ...
- Product: discovered from users which features would likely be successful

Our team is planning to begin work on a feature that allows cinch parters to publish the vehicles they
plan to sell to the cinch platform. How do we think feature flags could improve our performance now?

- The publishing feature is developed behind a flag
- Engineers:
- UX: Emily can independently release "UI/UX only" feature designs to garner qualitative RUM recorded
  sessions from Datadog or get anecdotal, qualitative feedback from partners.
- Product: Gemma can independently ...
- Business Analyst: Adam can independently ...

**The Why**

As engineers practicing trunk based development & continuous deployment, we often
want to be able to _deploy_ to production without necessarily _releasing_ to production.

Ideally, to shorten feedback loops and iterate well, we'd like to release only to users
who are ready to use young features and constructively criticise them or conduct "ring
releases" and progessively release features to increasing numbers of users if significant
errors are not occuring.

I think there's more to this than meets the eye from an engineering & sociotechnical
perspective when we think about how we can keep 'shifting left' (find & fix problems
earlier in the development process).

If a designer has two or three relatively simple designs for a widget, once the developers
have deployed them behind some kind of barrier, why should engineers be the gatekeepers for
the designer to 'release' the widget to users for feedback?

If designers, business analysts, or product owners want to conduct experiments, get in-production
qualitative feedback, or just release features they know customers are ready for, shouldn't they be
able to?

The benefits surely flow back to engineering in that by gathering feedback constantly;
changes are small, impactful iterations; bugs & problems are discovered earlier; new improvements
are imagined earlier?

Yes, engineers have to ensure releases are secure, easily observable, & that data from flagged
releases can easily be collated & analysed. However, this should be par for the course of
development anyway.

**What qualities would a feature flagging solution need to achieve this scenario?**

_Available at run time_

As described above, the point is to _separate_ release from deployment so we
shouldn't have to run a deployment pipeline in order to switch a feature on or configure a flag.

_Deeply configuable_

Flags should facilitate discretely releasing: to individual or small groups of users; to direct
proportions of traffic; or based on flag links to errors & monitoring.

_Auditable & removable_

With power comes responsibility: who's implemented & configured which flag & when is important
information that we want to be able to read in an audit log just like our commit histories.

**In summary**

There are technical reasons for adopting feature flags:

- Improves trunk based development by allowing safer, more frequent deployments
- Separates _deployment_ from _release_

There are sociotechnical reasons for adopting feature flags:

- Non engnieers enabled to use releases to:
  - plan & conduct experiments
  - get early & continuous feedback from users
  - share the benefits of flags coupled with observability
