```
"Well written code can be very communicative, but the message it conveys is
not guaranteed to be accurate. Oh, the reality of the behaviour caused by a
section of code is inescapable. But a method name can be ambiguous, misleading,
or out of date compared to the internals of the method. The assertions in a
test is rigourous, but the story told by variable names and the organisation
of the code is not. Good programming style keeps this connection as direct as
possible, but it is still an exercise in self discipline. It takes fastidiousness
to write code that doesn't just do the right thing but also says the right thing."
```

_Evans, Eric, [Domain Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215),_ _p.40_

#### Key Terms

1. _Domain_ - the business model being represented in code
2. _Ubiquitous language_ - the specialised, business language and jargon used to communicate consistently and meaningfully about the domain

```javascript
const namedWithDomainAndDesignInMind = trafficWardenIssuedFine()
// You know future you is thanking present you

const idiomaticallyNamedWithPairThink = penaltyRes()
// Future you despairs with younger, wilder you
```

My colleague [Emily](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emily-cheshire-uxdesigner/), a UX Designer, linked me to
a [great short talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1jVS96nJHMandt=126s) by one of her old colleagues [Jamie
Dickinson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dicko/) at Money Super Market about how everybody
can think of themselves as a designer. Apparently, the [tweet](https://twitter.com/jmspool/status/836955987860914176?lang=en)
by [Jared Spool](https://www.uie.com/jared-live/) that "everyone is a designer" sparked a lot of discussion.
Many people did not agree.

My penny's worth is that I would not call myself a designer. However, I would happily say that a code base or
architecture could be poorly designed so I must already have internalised some considerations of design to my
engineering. The talk made me wonder what lessons we can draw from the discipline of design thinking that could
help improve code written with domain driven design (DDD) in mind. Now that applications, infrastructure, and dashboards
can be all be noted as code, any marginal gain in the usability (and design) of code can be multiplied many times over.
Here, I want to focus specifically on naming: on readability as usability and how the tenants of design Jamie Dickinson
describes, can relate to Eric Evans' thoughts on code that 'doesn't just do the right thing but also says the right thing.'

It might seem obvious to say that we (engineers) are both the creators and the users. I'd still challenge that when
you've been working with people in a given domain for a while, it is easy to fall into "pair think" or "mob think"
where, despite the best of intentions, it can be hard to imagine not having fluency with the domain. This means that
it can be easy for terse and idiomatic but not necessarily readable and domain-influenced code to slip in.

Concise !== Clear and vice versa.

The code below saves characters with shortened and abbreviated names. It was / is probably intelligible to the dev
pair who wrote it. If they give it to the designer working on the gazillion dollar traffic warden software contract,
would they be able to have a good punt at deciphering what it is doing (in domain terms)?

```javascript
//
function handleFinePenMsg({
    prev,
    cmd,
}: CmdHndleArg<FinePenMsg>): Res<FinePenEvt> {
    if (!state.status) {
        return logicError(`dateTime out of range`)
    }

    const evt: FinePenEvt = createEvt('FinePenEvt', cmd)

    return {
        success: true,
        value: [evt],
    }
})
```

Code named with the domain should mean anyone with a working knowledge of parking fines in the UK can grasp what this function is doing:

```javascript
function handleTrafficWardenIssueParkingFineCommand({
  trafficWardenState,
  command,
}: CommandHandlerInput<TrafficWardenIssueParkingFineCommand>): Result<TrafficWardenIssuedParkingFine> {
  if (state.status !== Warden.OFF_DUTY) {
    return domainLogicError(
      `Warden cannot issue fine outside of shift hours. Current status: ${state.status}`
    )
  }

  const event: TrafficWardenIssuedParkingFine = createEvent(
    'TrafficWardenIssuedParkingFine',
    command
  )

  return {
    success: true,
    value: [event],
  }
}
```

## Spend characters naming

Brevity can be the enemy of clarity. Devs tend to like conciseness, me included. However, I am a sucker for spending
a few extra characters considering (often more verbose) domainSpecific names that more accurately describes how the
function and/or variable relates to the domain model. A few characters worth of brevity now is not necessarily time
saved when an engineer new to the domain is reading it in a year's time. If I am in doubt, I'll be wordy and use the
(hopefully documented) ubiquitous language. Aiming for 'self documenting' code in domain terms isa caring move for
future devs (and future you probably).

## Always include ubiquitous language

Jamie makes a good point about constraints actually being useful and providing good guard rails around which you can
be quite creative. "All names should include a reference to a ubiquitous language term" might not be a bad place
to start. Yes, I know, there will immediately be a dozen instances you can think of where that helps rather than
hinders. That's all well and good but perhaps the discipline of thinking through **why** that is the case will
prompt the team to be more conscientious about using domain terminology more widely, consistently, and appropriately
when naming. That in turn should lead to code that reflects the domain model more accurately.

## The Noob and the Box

Jamie suggests being "curious and play the role of a newbie". I think we could expand this to include "newbie to
your domain". Jamie suggests avoiding narrowly focused questions that only attain binary answers and do not require
considering a user's point of view because they likely cannot then address a design problem. Similarly, he suggests
that the cliched directive to "think outside the box" is often unhelpful in design thinking terms. There are two
helpful parallels here. Firstly, whilst in problem solving, approaching a problem from a novel perspective can be a
useful technique, when writing code, familiarity and convention are usually an engineer's friend. Secondly, one
purpose of learning, documenting, and using a domain's ubiquitous language is to _avoid_ imaginative new terminology that
obfuscates, rather than reveals, truths about the behaviour a domain model describes. In my experience, more often
than not, the ubiquitous langauge provides a good constraint demanding you be creative and thoughtful with your naming.
So, with integrating Domain Driven "Naming" in two simple questions as my constraint, I suggest using the following
questions as part of your naming process:

## 1. Would a domain noob engineer get this?

Or in other words: if I was new to, or unfamiliar with, this domain or subdomain, _how_ would I be able to relate
this code to the domain model?

## 2. Would a non engineer domain-fluent team member get this?

Or in other words: if I showed only the variable and function names to a non-engineering colleague on my team who was
familiar with the ubiquitous language of the domain, _how_ would they be able to relate the function to the domain
reasonably accurately?

Please share any thoughts you have on the topic :)
