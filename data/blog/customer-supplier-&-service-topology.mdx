summary: 'Examining a DDD Customer-Supplier Relationship in Light of a Service Team Topology'
---

Eric Evans describes a Domain Driven Design 'Customer-Supplier' relationship between bounded contexts
as one in which although the customers influence the data a supplier provides, it is the supplier who
ultimately determines what and how information is transferred in the relationship. Manuel Pais and
Matthew Skelton describe a Service team in their exploration of 'Team Topologies' as ...
Where do the respective niches of these concepts overlap and diverge? To what extent to these ideas
compliment or conflict with each other? Practically, how might exploring these questions be a means
for an engineer to better understand and design components of a system that have an upstream-downstream
aspect?

# Convergence

The concepts of Domain Driven Design and Team Topologies converge on:

# Approach

It is also worth noting where the the concepts approach each other, but do not overlap, more through virtue
of identifying where we might usefully bridge those gaps.

# Compliments

# Example

You and your team have been tasked with building a B2B based service. The customers and users
who will use your service already sell a single type of asset X via the

Imagine a system best characterised as 'joined-at-the-database' in the team topologies sense.
This database powers a B2C based set of services through a mixture of messages and http apis.
The database aims to be
a 'single source of truth' for data for the business. The messages published by the service
concern a single type of asset X. For reasons lost in the mist of undocumented time, the data
service emits a combination of messages: some could be described as 'domain events' (roughly
hewing to an event arising due to a domain specific piece of business logic); others as
'property sourced' events (describing a database record property changing without context,
intent, or reason, e.g. nameChanged).
