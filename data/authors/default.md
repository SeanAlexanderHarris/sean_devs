I engineer at [cinch](https://www.cinch.co.uk/). I work with my team to build well architected serverless systems to help improve the way cinch and its partners work together. As the "automation engineer" on the team, I am also chiefly responsible for leading on strong devops practices &maintaining deep observability.

I'm a big advocate of using Domain Driven Design to understand and model systems as well as eventsourcing & CQRS where appropriate (which it often is in my experience).

Previously, I taught secondary school English in Liverpool with the educational charity [TeachFirst](https://www.teachfirst.org.uk/).

In my free time, I love to read, [cycle](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1847099), travel, and [code](https://github.com/SeanAlexanderHarris).
